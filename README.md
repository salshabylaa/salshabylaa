An Informatics Engineering student from Indonesia, currently in my 5th semester, with a strong focus on software development and data analysis. My expertise lies in web and mobile programming, as well as data processing. I have experience in both individual and team projects, complemented by excellent communication skills and a results-oriented mindset.

I enjoy building innovative software and solving real-world challenges. I believe that technology should be a tool for creating meaningful solutionsâ€”whether through mobile applications that improve public services, or user-friendly systems that streamline complex processes.

> I see technology not just as code, but as a conversation between people and problems â€” a continuous journey of learning, building, and improving to create meaningful solutions.

Right now, my main focus is on creating impactful, user-centric applications, leveraging my skills in mobile and web development to build solutions that truly matter.
